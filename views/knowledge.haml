        ## Rocky Mountain Ruby 2011.
        <date>08.1.2011</date>

        We're proud to announce that we are officially a Silver sponsor of the upcoming Rocky Mountain Ruby conference in Boulder. In addition, Jay will be speaking on Thursday afternoon, and we'll be co-sponsoring (with our good friends at Pivotal Boulder) the closing party at Avery Brewing Company.

        &nbsp;

        To celebrate, we thought we'd do something fun and give away a free conference registration to one lucky soul. To put your name in the hat, hit us up on twitter (@bittheory_) before monday.  We'll be drawing a winner at random first thing monday morning.
