      %h1 process.
      %p We all come from advertising agency backgrounds, so we've collectively spent years operating in environments high in stress, churn, and uncertainty.  From those experiences, we've developed a passion for agile methodologies that embrace change instead of fighting it.  Bit Theory's process is designed to take advantage of that passion, and offer our clients maximum flexibility and responsiveness while maintaining high quality and preserving everyone's sanity.

      %h2 the meet.
      %p Interested in what we have to offer?  Give us a ring or drop us a line. Coffee, lunch, or a beer - let’s chat and figure out if there’s common ground and an opportunity to make some magic happen. Even if now isn’t the right time for a project, we’re always happy to make an introduction or even just shoot the breeze.

      %h2 the inception.
      %p Our first step towards a real project is what we call an “inception meeting”.  We take somewhere between a few hours and a day to meet with your team in person, face-to-face.  We’ll sketch out your needs, desires, directions, and pain points, hash out rough goals and tactics, and try to wrap our collective brains around a rough scope. We’ll also start to divide features into small, independent chunks of work called stories - the common language of the project - and organize them into a backlog.  Our hope is that both sides will leave this session with a clearer sense of what the business priorities are and how they can can be accomplished during an engagement. We can also discuss logistics like team size, start date, and work location arrangements.

      %h2 the process.
      %p We operate in terms of “iterations” - cycles that encompasses the product owner (you) prioritizing the highest-value work, the development team (us) performing and delivering that work, and the entire team retrospecting on what’s been accomplished and where to go next. We work through the backlog from the top down, so our developers maximize the value they’re delivering via your prioritization of the items in the backlog. At the end of an iteration we re-prioritize and discuss the plan of attack for the subsequent iteration. This includes refining the stories in the backlog, generating new stories based on changing business needs, and evaluating project status as it relates to time, budget, and scope. We crave constant communication and feedback. This cycle is deliberately short to tighten the feedback loop, and iterations are typically only one week in length.

      %h2 the engagement.
      %p Our minimum engagement is just two weeks, and we operate on a “first month’s rent” model - you pay for the first two weeks upfront, and can cancel after any iteration without penalties or hurt feelings. To keep things sustainable we cap our hours at 40 per week per developer.

      %h2 the wrap.
      %p We understand that your priorities, budgets, and needs may change over the course of an engagement. If you’re looking to staff up an internal team to take over development, we can help you evaluate candidates, hire, and transition to that team. Need more or fewer developers? We can easily ramp up or down on a per-iteration basis.
