            <h1>process.</h1>
            <p>we come from advertising agency backgrounds, so we've collectively spent years operating in environments high in stress, churn, and uncertainty.  from those experiences, we've developed a passion for agile methodologies that embrace change instead of fighting it.  bit theory's process is designed to take advantage of that passion, and offer our clients maximum flexibility and responsiveness while maintaining high quality and preserving everyone's sanity.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='col-first'>
            <h2>the meet.</h2>
            <p>Interested in what we have to offer?  Give us a ring or drop us a line. Coffee, lunch, or a beer - let’s chat and figure out if there’s common ground and an opportunity to make some magic happen. Even if now isn’t the right time for a project, we’re always happy to make an introduction or even just shoot the breeze.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='col-first'>
            <h2>the inception.</h2>
            <p>Our first step towards a real project is what we call an “inception meeting”.  We take somewhere between a few hours and a day to meet with your team in person, face-to-face.  We’ll sketch out your needs, desires, directions, and pain points, hash out rough goals and tactics, and try to wrap our collective brains around a rough scope. We’ll also start to divide features into small, independent chunks of work called stories - the common language of the project - and organize them into a backlog.  Our hope is that both sides will leave this session with a clearer sense of what the business priorities are and how they can can be accomplished during an engagement. We can also discuss logistics like team size, start date, and work location arrangements.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='col-first'>
            <h2>the process.</h2>
            <p>We operate in terms of “iterations” - cycles that encompasses the product owner (you) prioritizing the highest-value work, the development team (us) performing and delivering that work, and the entire team retrospecting on what’s been accomplished and where to go next. We work through the backlog from the top down, so our developers maximize the value they’re delivering via your prioritization of the items in the backlog. At the end of an iteration we re-prioritize and discuss the plan of attack for the subsequent iteration. This includes refining the stories in the backlog, generating new stories based on changing business needs, and evaluating project status as it relates to time, budget, and scope. We crave constant communication and feedback. This cycle is deliberately short to tighten the feedback loop, and iterations are typically only one week in length.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='col-first'>
            <h2>the engagement.</h2>
            <p>Our minimum engagement is just two weeks, and we operate on a “first month’s rent” model - you pay for the first two weeks upfront, and can cancel after any iteration without penalties or hurt feelings. To keep things sustainable we cap our hours at 40 per week per developer.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='col-first'>
            <h2>the wrap.</h2>
            <p>We understand that your priorities, budgets, and needs may change over the course of an engagement. If you’re looking to staff up an internal team to take over development, we can help you evaluate candidates, hire, and transition to that team. Need more or fewer developers? We can easily ramp up or down on a per-iteration basis.</p>

            <h2>languages.</h2>
            <p>
              <p>working across various programming languages is really just acquainting yourself on the language&#8217;s syntax and its nuances. we approach all languages the same. instill the best practices provided by test/behavior driven development, understand the core principles provided by design patterns and our own experiences. apply those practices to the languages. it&#8217;s really not that complicated. we like to tell the machine what to do and how to do it. over the years, we&#8217;ve migrated towards languages we feel enable this type of practice. we love to spend our days in ruby, html5, css, javascript, objective c, scala, and c/c++. we have extensive knowledge in python, java, actionscript, and php. we are constantly evaluating tools and assessing the right one for the job at hand.</p>

            <h2>frameworks.</h2>
            <p>
              <p>the open source community has created a revolution in programming that most people may never understand. it&#8217;s advanced the progression of language and framework development. it&#8217;s tapped into the collective knowledge of millions of developers and progressed our understanding of how applications integrate with various frameworks and systems. frameworks have made our jobs easier, but understanding the power and downfalls of each of these OSS frameworks, requires a developer to look under the covers and understand what each of these libraries do. we do that. we are constantly evaluating OSS frameworks and how we should apply those to the software we are constructing. we tend to lean towards frameworks that are tested well, and have proven track records in real-world applications. we spend a lot of time in <a href='http://www.rubyonrails.org/'>ruby on rails</a>, <a href='http://www.jquery.org/'>jQuery</a>, <a href='http://www.sinatrarb.com/'>sinatra</a>, <a href='http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/'>backbone</a>, <a href='http://three20.info/'>three20</a>, <a href='http://nodejs.org/'>node.js</a>, <a href='http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/'>ext.js</a> and <a href='http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/'>sencha touch</a>. we&#8217;ve spent countless hours in other libraries such as <a href='http://www.prototypejs.org/'>prototype</a>, <a href='http://www.mootools.net/'>mootools</a>, <a href='http://www.adobe.com/products/flex'>flex</a>, <a href='http://www.djangoproject.com/'>django</a>, <a href='http://www.processing.org/'>processing</a>/<a href='http://www.processingjs.org/'>processing.js</a>, and even <a href='https://github.com/bit-theory'>written a few of our own</a>. just as with languages, we like to provide the right tool for the job at hand.</p>

            <h2>infrastructure.</h2>
            <p>
              <p>innovation in languages and frameworks has spurred a similarly momentous revolution in infrastructure and deployment stacks. utility computing and cloud providers have democratized sophisticated technologies that were previously available only to fortune 500 companies with massive infrastructure budgets. at the same time, the dizzying array of options makes it harder than ever to know that you&#8217;re getting exactly what you need from your infrastructure without overpaying. we understand the players in the space, the product offerings, and the tradeoffs inherent in a wide variety of deployment architectures. we&#8217;ve built and scaled major apps on <a href='http://www.rackspace.com/'>rackspace</a>, <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/'>amazon</a>, and private infrastructures. we&#8217;ve integrated with data and cache stores from <a href='http://www.mysql.com/'>mysql</a> to <a href='http://redis.io/'>redis</a>, <a href='http://memcached.org/'>memcached</a> to <a href='http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/index.html'>oracle</a>, and we&#8217;ve been doing <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps'>devops</a> since before it was a buzzword. in short, we&#8217;re all about using the right tools to build an infrastructure that enables your business - to prime you for current and future success without breaking the bank.</p>
