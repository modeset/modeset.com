    # how we work.
    we come from advertising agency backgrounds, so we've collectively spent
    years operating in environments high in stress, churn, and uncertainty.
    from those experiences, we've developed a passion for agile methodologies
    that embrace change instead of fighting it.  mode set's process is designed
    to take advantage of that passion, and offer our clients maximum
    flexibility and responsiveness while maintaining high quality and
    preserving everyone's sanity.

    ## the meet.
    Interested in what we have to offer?  Give us a ring or drop us a line.
    Coffee, lunch, or a beer - let’s chat and figure out if there’s common
    ground and an opportunity to make some magic happen. Even if now isn’t the
    right time for a project, we’re always happy to make an introduction or
    even just shoot the breeze.

    ## the inception.
    Our first step towards a real project is what we call an “inception
    meeting”.  We take somewhere between a few hours and a day to meet with
    your team in person, face-to-face.  We’ll sketch out your needs, desires,
    directions, and pain points, hash out rough goals and tactics, and try to
    wrap our collective brains around a rough scope. We’ll also start to divide
    features into small, independent chunks of work called stories - the common
    language of the project - and organize them into a backlog.  Our hope is
    that both sides will leave this session with a clearer sense of what the
    business priorities are and how they can can be accomplished during an
    engagement. We can also discuss logistics like team size, start date, and
    work location arrangements.

    ## the process.
    We operate in terms of “iterations” - cycles that encompasses the product
    owner (you) prioritizing the highest-value work, the development team (us)
    performing and delivering that work, and the entire team retrospecting on
    what’s been accomplished and where to go next. We work through the backlog
    from the top down, so our developers maximize the value they’re delivering
    via your prioritization of the items in the backlog. At the end of an
    iteration we re-prioritize and discuss the plan of attack for the
    subsequent iteration. This includes refining the stories in the backlog,
    generating new stories based on changing business needs, and evaluating
    project status as it relates to time, budget, and scope. We crave constant
    communication and feedback. This cycle is deliberately short to tighten the
    feedback loop, and iterations are typically only one week in length.

    ## the engagement.
    Our minimum engagement is just two weeks, and we operate on a “first
    month’s rent” model - you pay for the first two weeks upfront, and can
    cancel after any iteration without penalties or hurt feelings. To keep
    things sustainable we cap our hours at 40 per week per developer.

    ## the wrap.
    We understand that your priorities, budgets, and needs may change over the
    course of an engagement. If you’re looking to staff up an internal team to
    take over development, we can help you evaluate candidates, hire, and
    transition to that team. Need more or fewer developers? We can easily ramp
    up or down on a per-iteration basis.

    ## we believe in.
    - Transparent and open client relationships
    - Software development as a creative process
    - Short feedback cycles
    - Continuously releasable software
    - Small cross-functional teams
    - Sustainable working schedules
    - Test-driven development
    - Paired programming
    - Continuous reflection and improvement
