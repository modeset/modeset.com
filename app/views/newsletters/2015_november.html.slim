h1 Mode Set: November 2015
h4
  | It's been a whirlwind year at Mode Set and we wanted to reconnect with old friends to share some exciting developments. 
  | What better way to kill all the birds than with one newsletter rock?
h4 Let's do this.

      h4 Our Sister Ello
      p
        | Maybe you heard of her? Like any hungry startup baby in a growth spurt, she kept us awake all hours of the night, requiring constant care and feeding while growing at an unprecedented pace. 
        | It was zero to 60 in six days, and we wouldn't trade the experience for anything. We learned a lot on this ride, both inspirational and humbling. 
        | With the birth of Ello as an independent organization, we lost a handful of our Mode Setters. Mode Set and Ello co-founders, Jay Zeschin and Matt Kitt, transitioned to Ello full-time. 
        | Ryan Boyajian, resident rock-star and super rad developer, also made the switch. We still see their ugly-mugs everyday, because Ello and Mode Set share office space, 
        | which means the family table just got a little bigger and the resulting knowledge share more beneficial.

      h4 Mode Set Updates
      p
        | Gabe Varela and Justin Gitlin, co-founders and managing directors, are running the Mode Set team full steam ahead with a renewed focus in cultivating budding tech startups and continuing to 
        | expand our portfolio with creative projects and innovative installations that fuse tech and art. Look for our year-end portfolio review in a couple months. 
        | Newest recruits to the team include Bree Thomas and Micah Adams. Check out their profiles on the #{link_to "Team", "http://modeset.com/team"} page of our refreshed website!

      h4 Client Spotlight
      p
        | We've had the pleasure of working with access.mobile over the past few months, a company pioneering healthcare innovation in Africa. Our client, Kaakpema Yelpaala - "KP", 
        | recently moved his family to Uganda to focus fulltime on the business, which is gaining traction with users and investors alike. We're proud to work with someone so passionate about the business, 
        | and a true partner who invested in our process fully. As a result of our efforts, KP launched a smart minimum viable product, on time and in budget. 
        | It's receiving great response and validation in the marketplace. Additionally, we sent our project lead, Mike Pack, to Uganda to train KP's resident development team in modern development practices and methodologies. 
        | Through this experience, we were able to help KP craft strategy for scaling his team and business, along with validating various market constraints critical in our next round of feature development.

          | This post encapsulates how I have always perceived agile. Most companies neglect to apply the actual core tenants of agile and instead of approaching agile as a process that is about adaptation and improvement.

            | A post from last year and still one of my favorites. I decided to reread it, because it appears we'll get another strong female character in the latest Star Wars installment for girls to idolize, which I applaud. 
            | "And as far as girlhood obsessions that turn into grown-up life lessons go... Take charge, be brave, be loyal, have nice hair, and strangle to death the monster who forces you to wear an inappropriate bikini." 
            | AND - "There is..., a lot of money to be made by taking Princess Leia seriously. Hurry the fuck up."

            | Maciej Ceg≈Çowsk's talk at the Fremtidens Internet conference in Copenhagen argues that advertising related surveillance is destroying any semblance of online privacy, and venture capitalists are doing exactly nothing to change it. 
            | This polarizing talk asks us to consider if there is something more we can do to provide true technical change in a world where ad robots artificially create profits from thin air.
