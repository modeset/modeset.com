we’re proud to announce that we are officially a silver sponsor of the [2011 rocky mountain ruby conference](http://rockymtnruby.com/2011) in boulder. in addition, jay will be speaking on thursday afternoon, and we’ll be co-sponsoring the closing party at [avery brewing company](http://averybrewing.com/tap-room/) with our good friends at [pivotal boulder](http://pivotallabs.com/).
 
to celebrate, we thought we’d do something fun and give away a free conference registration to one lucky soul. to put your name in the hat, hit us up on twitter (@modeset_) before monday. we’ll be drawing a winner at random first thing monday morning.
 
**update:** and the winner is&hellip;jon hoyt ([@jonmagic](https://twitter.com/jonmagic)). congrats jon, we’ll see you in boulder!
