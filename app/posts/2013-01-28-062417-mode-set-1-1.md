As we're all starting to finally get settled into 2013, we're happy to announce the launch of an updated and refreshed [modeset.com](http://modeset.com/).

We've refined and refocused our business in the months since we began, focusing on the clients, projects and technologies that allow us to deliver the greatest returns for our clients and derive the most joy from our work. In a parallel vein, we wanted to refocus our site - to better elucidate what we do, how we operate, the principles that we hold dear. We wanted a central place to share some of our awesome clients and projects, instead of having them scattered across the internet. We wanted a place to talk about our [open source projects](https://github.com/modeset). We wanted an archive of events we've been [involved in](http://www.denverstartupweek.org/) and helped [organize](https://github.com/modeset/rubyconf5k) and/or [sponsor](http://www.bordobello.com/).

Our site served us well for about a year and a half. However, as is the case with many young companies, we have evolved and find ourselves in a substantially different place than we were just 18 months ago. As we've grown, diversified, and gotten more experience under our collective belts, we've realized that what we had up was no longer sufficient. Like a historic house, it has a solid foundation but was in need of renovation.

So, what did we change? In short, we refocused. We've cleaned up code, copy, and presentation across the site. We've updated and clarified [our way of working](http://modeset.com/how-we-work). Four months after he joined our team, we've finally added a bio for [Jeremy Jackson](https://github.com/jejacks0n/) (sorry, Jeremy!). Because we're big believers in radical openness and transparency, we've followed the lead of our friends at [Thunderbolt Labs](http://www.thunderboltlabs.com/) and are stating our rate and engagement parameters upfront and publicly. Last but certainly not least, we've incorporated a [vastly improved blog](http://www.modeset.com/what-we-know) that's much better suited for longer content and updates.

The plumbing of the site has changed quite a bit as well. We moved from a system built on Sinatra, Backbone, and static templates to a one-file Rails app (post on that coming soon!) using [Utensils](https://github.com/modeset/utensils), [Postmarkdown](https://github.com/ennova/postmarkdown), and [HTML::Pipeline](https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline). We write posts in markdown, review them via pull requests, and deploy on Heroku. We welcome feedback but decided not to integrate commenting into the site - however, posts will always be cross-posted to [Twitter](http://twitter.com/modeset_) for easy discussion. 

As always, we're eternally grateful to our friends, clients, and collaborators for sticking with us and entrusting us with their time, attention, and business. You guys rock and we wouldn't be here without you. Thanks for following us so far, and here's to many more great times to come.
