There are a lot of exciting projects getting ready to kick off in our neighborhood in the next few months. Between [The Lab](http://denverinfill.com/blog/2013/10/new-central-platte-valley-project-the-lab.html), the new Grand American building at 19th St., and [Galvanize 2.0](http://denverinfill.com/blog/2013/10/new-central-platte-valley-project-galvanize-2-0.html), things are going to change pretty dramatically over the course of the next year or so.

One of the first major signs of progress came yesterday as a group of us was walking back from lunch. we just happened to be walking by the old TOSA building as the demolition crew was pulling down the second and third stories:
