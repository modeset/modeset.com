It probably goes without saying that we're big fans of the startup community here in Denver - many of our friends and clients build, run, or work for/with local early stage companies, and it's been amazing to watch the amplitude of startup activity grow exponentially. The difference even just in the two years since we started Mode Set is staggering and humbling.

so naturally, we're really proud to support [Denver Startup Week](http://www.denverstartupweek.org/), an incredible annual weeklong conference-plus-expo-plus-party that serves as a catalyst and rallying point for the entire startup community. It started last year with [Erik Mitisek](http://www.mitisek.com/) and [Ben Deda](https://twitter.com/Ben_Deda) concepting the idea for a large-scale event that could serve to give Denver startups a sense of cohesion and identity that had previously been either lacking or nonexistent. Put differently, there were already a ton of companies here solving big problems and doing great things, but they lacked the resources and support that a greater lattice and community bonds could provide. Erik and Ben joined forces with [Tami Door](https://twitter.com/TamiDoor), the head of the Downtown Denver Partnership and "unofficial mayor" of downtown Denver, and kicked off an intense sprint of effort to get what would become Denver Startup Week 1.0 off the ground. 

I came on board shortly thereafter to help organize the Tech track programming, among other things. 

DSW is truly a startup event in two senses - we're focused on a startup audience, and we are a startup ourselves. That combination gives us a unique perspective as event organizers, I think, and serves as a constant reminder of why the event is relevant and important to begin with.

At the inaugural DSW last October, around 3800 attendees came out for 70 events across 4 programming tracks, and a number of marquee and social events that took place each evening. Not too shabby for a first-year event. Going into the week, with no basis for comparison, we were just hoping that at least a few people would actually show up!

DSW 2013 (2.0) is coming up next week, and we couldn't be more excited. It's substantially larger this year, with over 150 events at last count, and we (the organizing committee) are aiming for a corresponding increase in attendees. There is amazing content lined up across tracks focused on Business, Design, Tech, and Manufacturing, some awesome marquee panel discussions, totally rad social events scheduled each evening, and a totally new dedicated popup headquarters located right on the 16th St Mall. The energy and buzz around the event is tremendous and it hasn't even started yet!

Of course, we'll be around the marquee social events in the evenings as well. Keep an eye out for the blue shirts, and hit us up if you want to grab a beer and shoot the shit. or just grab a "make code not war" sticker. that's cool too.

It's going to be an amazing week. We can't wait to see you out there.
